# 🤖 Robot Widget

A **self-contained animated robot widget** that can be embedded into any web page with **zero external dependencies**.  
The widget dynamically injects all required **CSS, SVG, and JavaScript** at runtime, ensuring full isolation from the host page’s styles and scripts.

## ✨ Features

- Floating animated robot (SVG-based, fully scalable)
- Smooth eye tracking that follows the user’s mouse
- Natural blinking behavior (including random double blinks)
- Dynamic shadow synchronized with motion
- No external libraries or assets required
- Safe to embed on any website (IIFE encapsulation)
